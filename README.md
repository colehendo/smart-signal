# SmartSignal

Smart Signal was created as a price prediction platform, with the core intention being to display aptitude for both frontend and backend coding, as well as cloud infrastructure knowledge and applicability.

The application ingests historical prices for several cryptocurrencies, and based on a set of indicators, makes future price predictions. Although the solution did not present the results we had hoped for due to a severe lack of math and data engineering, the software worked exactly as intended, allowing us to seamlessly ingest prices and make real-time decisions based on changes seen. Furthermore, the web UI provided a robust visualization of these changes, allowing manual decisions to be made as well.
